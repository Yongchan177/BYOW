# BYOW

This here was the final project for CS61B: Data Structures course where we were tasked to build our own world and develop a tile based game. 

## Project Spec
https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj3/proj3

## Overview
We generated a random world using a seed specified by the player and then converted the game to an Endgame challenge, where you have to collect the infinity stones and each stone would give you a power like the ability to jump or teleport.
